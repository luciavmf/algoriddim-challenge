Algoriddim Challenge. Solves the task described in [Algoriddim - iOS Task.pages](Algoriddim%20-%20iOS%20Task.pages)


### Dependencies
The project uses the [SwiftLint](https://swiftpackageindex.com/realm/SwiftLint) package to enforce common conventions. This package is not necessary and can be removed.

### Notes
* The project is currently not supporting localizations or accesibility.
* The landscape mode for the first and second page could be improved. It might look better if the "djay" logo is on the left. Also, is the onboarding button is on the right side of the screen.
